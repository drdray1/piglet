# Piglet Wardriver

**Piglet** is an open-source ESP32-based wardriving platform that scans nearby Wi-Fi networks, records GPS position, saves WiGLE-compatible CSV logs to SD, and provides a real-time web UI for control, uploads, and device status.

Designed for **[Seeed XIAO ESP32-S3](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/xiao_esp32s3_getting_started/), [XIAO ESP32-C5](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/xiao_esp32c5_getting_started/), [XIAO ESP32-C6](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/xiao_esp32c6_getting_started/), and [XIAO ESP32-C3](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/XIAO_ESP32C3_Getting_Started/)**, Piglet focuses on:

- Reliable scanning while in motion  
- Clean WiGLE-ready data collection  
- Simple field deployment  
- Fully hackable open firmware


## Features

- 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi scanning  
- 5 GHz scanning on ESP32-C5 hardware  
- **Bluetooth LE wardriving** — passive BLE scan logged to the same WiGLE CSV (`Type=BLE`); opt-in via `bleEnabled=true`. In mesh mode, Nodes forward BLE observations to the Core. Requires the NimBLE-Arduino library.
- GPS position, heading, and speed logging  
- SD card logging in WiGLE CSV format  
- Web UI for:
  - Start / stop scanning  
  - Upload logs to WiGLE  
  - View device status  
  - Manage SD files  
  - Edit configuration  
- OLED live status display  
- Optional battery monitoring (board dependent)  
- Automatic STA connect with AP fallback  
- Optimized for mobile wardriving or warWalking!
- **ESP-Now Mesh Node mode** — pair with a coordinator device for multi-node wardriving
- **Mesh auto-start on boot** — configure `meshModeOnBoot` to automatically enter Core or Node mode after uploads complete, bypassing the AP window
- **Screen rotation** — mount the display upside-down and set `rotateScreen180=true` to flip 180°
- **Auto-start wardriving after uploads** — set `autoStartAfterUpload=true` to disconnect from home Wi-Fi immediately after boot uploads complete and begin scanning without delay
- **PigletNode** — standalone minimal firmware for XIAO ESP32-C5 that boots directly as a mesh node (no display, GPS, or SD required), scanning Wi-Fi **and** BLE


## ESP-Now Mesh Network Node Mode

Piglet includes a built-in **Mesh Node mode** that lets it act as a wireless wardriving node alongside a compatible coordinator device. In this mode, Piglet scans Wi-Fi networks and forwards results over ESP-Now — no SD card or GPS fix required on Piglet itself. The coordinator handles GPS stamping and data logging.

### Compatible Coordinator Devices

- **Biscuit Pro** by [Hedge / Biscuit Shop](https://biscuitshop.us)
- **JCMK C5 Wardriver** by JustCallMeKoko

### How to Use

1. Power on your coordinator device (Biscuit Pro or JCMK C5 Wardriver)
2. On Piglet, press the button to cycle pages until you reach **Mesh Node** (the last page after the pig animation)
3. Piglet automatically searches for a coordinator on ESP-Now channel 6
4. Once connected, it receives a channel range assignment and begins forwarding scan data
5. Press the button again to exit Mesh Node mode and return to normal wardriving

### Mesh Node Display

While in Mesh Node mode the OLED shows:
- Link status (Searching / Core linked)
- Coordinator MAC address
- Assigned channel range
- Total networks discovered
- Records forwarded to the coordinator

> **Note:** Entering Mesh Node mode suspends normal WiGLE CSV logging. All data is sent live to the coordinator. Exiting the page restores normal scanning automatically.

### Auto-Start Mesh Mode on Boot

Set `meshModeOnBoot` in `/wardriver.cfg` to automatically enter mesh mode after boot uploads are complete, without needing to navigate pages manually:

| Value | Behaviour |
|-------|-----------|
| `none` | Normal wardriving (default) |
| `core` | Enters Mesh Core mode — acts as coordinator, logs records from nodes |
| `node` | Enters Mesh Node mode — forwards scan results to a Core |

When `core` or `node` is set the SoftAP window is **skipped entirely** (ESP-Now owns the WiFi stack and the AP would be non-functional). The device goes straight from boot uploads to the mesh page. Set via the web UI **Mesh Mode On Boot** dropdown or directly in `/wardriver.cfg`.

### Assigning Node Scan Roles (Core SD config)

By default every node scans **both** Wi-Fi and BLE. From the **Core's** `/wardriver.cfg` you can dedicate each node to a single radio — e.g. some nodes Wi-Fi-only and others BLE-only — addressed by the node's full MAC:

```
nodeDefaultRole=both              # role for any node not listed (wifi | ble | both)
node.A1B2C3D4E5F6=wifi            # this node: Wi-Fi only
node.A1B2C3D4E5F7=ble             # this node: BLE only
```

The role is delivered to each node over the existing mesh link (it rides the channel-assignment frame), so **no node-side config is needed** — a PigletNode honors any role directly. To discover a node's MAC, watch the Core's **Serial** output: when a node joins, the Core prints its full MAC and a ready-to-paste `node.<mac>=...` line. The Core's OLED mesh page also shows a per-node role glyph (`W` / `B` / `2`).

Notes: a main-sketch or T-Dongle C5 node must also keep its own `bleEnabled=true` to honor a `ble`/`both` role (a `bleEnabled=false` node can only do Wi-Fi). Role edits are read once at boot — **reboot the Core** to apply. Old/3rd-party JCMK cores that don't send roles leave every node at `both`.


### Blacklisting networks/devices from the save file

Keep specific networks or devices out of the CSV entirely — e.g. your own home Wi-Fi or personal phones — with one entry per line in `wardriver.cfg`. MACs accept colons or bare 12-hex, and an inline `# label` is kept so the file documents itself:

```
blacklistMac=AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF    # My phone
blacklistMac=112233445566         # Home router
blacklistSsid=MyHomeNet           # Home network
blacklistSsid=iPhone              # phone BLE name
```

Matching is **exact** — a MAC matches on the full address, an SSID/BLE-name on the whole string (case-insensitive); there are no wildcards, so `MyHomeNet` does not filter `MyHomeNet2`. The `blacklistSsid` list also matches BLE device names. Up to 16 entries of each. The filter runs at CSV write time, so on a **Core** it drops both locally-scanned and mesh-forwarded node observations. Reboot to apply edits.

### Log-once dedup

By default Piglet logs each Wi-Fi BSSID and each BLE MAC **once per boot** — repeat sightings of the same device are suppressed so the CSV stays compact and (on a Core) the mesh isn't flooded. The ring holding recently-seen addresses is capped by `bleMaxResults`.

Turn it off with a single global switch in `wardriver.cfg` when you want **every** sighting written — e.g. for dwell-time analysis, RSSI-over-time, or debugging:

```
dedupEnabled=true     # default: each MAC/BSSID logged once
dedupEnabled=false    # log every sighting
```

This covers both Wi-Fi and BLE on the main Piglet firmware and on the T-Dongle C5 firmware (the Core / single-device setup). Blacklisting always runs first, so blacklisted devices are dropped regardless of this setting. The dedicated PigletNode firmware keeps its own log-once forwarding and is not affected by this flag. Reboot to apply.


## Bluetooth LE Wardriving

Piglet can passively scan for Bluetooth LE devices alongside Wi-Fi and log them to the **same WiGLE-1.6 CSV** with `Type=BLE` — so a single upload to WiGLE or WDGoWars carries both Wi-Fi and BLE observations.

- **Opt-in** on the main firmware and on the **T-Dongle C5** firmware: set `bleEnabled=true` in `wardriver.cfg` (config block below). Off by default — no flash/RAM cost when disabled.
- **Always on** in the dedicated PigletNode firmware (see below).
- **What's logged per device:** address + type (`[LE Public]` / `[LE Random]` / `[LE Resolvable]` / `[LE NonResolvable]`), advertised name, RSSI, 16-bit service UUIDs (in the RCOIs column, e.g. `FE9F;180F`), and the manufacturer company ID (MfgrId) — all GPS-stamped like Wi-Fi rows.
- **In a mesh cluster:** each Node scans Wi-Fi and/or BLE (per its [assigned role](#assigning-node-scan-roles-core-sd-config), default both) and forwards observations to the Core, which stamps them with its own GPS and logs them. Nodes need no GPS or SD. Log-once dedupe keeps a device from flooding the log and the mesh.
- **On the OLED:** the Status and Networks pages show a live BLE count; the mesh page shows BLE received (Core) and forwarded (Node).
- **Library:** requires **NimBLE-Arduino 2.1.x** for any BLE build. See [`LIBRARIES.md`](LIBRARIES.md).

Tuning knobs in `wardriver.cfg`: `bleScanDuration` (window length), `bleScanInterval` (time between windows), `bleMaxResults` (memory cap), `dedupEnabled` (log-once on/off — see [Log-once dedup](#log-once-dedup)). The mesh wire format is documented in [`docs/PROTOCOL.md`](docs/PROTOCOL.md).


## PigletNode — Standalone Mesh Node

A minimal, standalone firmware for the **Seeed XIAO ESP32-C5** in the `PigletNode/` folder. No display, GPS, or SD card required — flash it and it automatically pairs with any Piglet running in Core mode and begins scanning.

- Single-file Arduino sketch (plus the bundled `Ble*.h` headers for BLE)
- Boots directly into JCMK-compatible ESP-Now node mode
- Dual-band Wi-Fi scanning: 40 channels (2.4 GHz ch 1–14 + 5 GHz UNII-1/2/2e/3)
- **Always-on BLE scanning** — forwards Bluetooth LE observations to the Core
  over ESP-Now alongside Wi-Fi (the Core geotags and logs them)
- Auto-pairs with Piglet Core mode (XIAO or T-Dongle)
- 30-second Core timeout with automatic re-search
- LED: fast blink = searching, slow blink = paired and scanning
- Hold BOOT button > 2 s to force a re-search

**Flash:** Open `PigletNode/PigletNode.ino` in Arduino IDE, select **XIAO_ESP32C5**, upload. Requires the **NimBLE-Arduino 2.1.x** library (for BLE).


## T-Dongle C5 Variant

A standalone firmware port is available for the **LilyGo T-Dongle C5** in the `TDongleC5_Piglet/` folder. This variant is a self-contained single-file sketch with its own display driver, LED control, and web UI — no external OLED required.

**Hardware:** LilyGo T-Dongle C5 (ESP32-C5, built-in ST7735 0.96" TFT, APA102 LED, TF card slot)

**Additional GPS:** Connect any UART GPS module via the Qwiic/JST connector (RX=GPIO12, TX=GPIO11)

**Pages:** Status · Networks · Navigation · Pig animation · Mesh Node

**BLE wardriving:** Supported, opt-in via `bleEnabled=true` in `/wardriver.cfg`
(reboot to apply). Standalone, the dongle scans BLE alongside Wi-Fi and writes
`Type=BLE` rows to the same CSV. As a mesh **Node** it forwards observations to
the Core; as a **Core** it logs what its nodes forward and does not scan BLE
itself — the same split as the XIAO firmware. Scanning is observer-only and
never transmits. Requires the **NimBLE-Arduino** library (see below).

### T-Dongle C5 Required Libraries

Install via Arduino Library Manager (`Sketch → Include Library → Manage Libraries`):

**Assembly Note:** When stacking modules, apply **Kapton tape** between components to prevent electrical shorts. Pay special attention to exposed pins and solder joints that may contact adjacent modules.


## First Time Run Initialization

The Wardriver functions using a config file located on the root of a FAT32-formatted SD card. On first boot the device will start its own access point (`Piglet-WARDRIVE` / `wardrive1234`) so you can connect and fill in your settings via the web interface — or you can place the config file on the SD card manually before powering on.

**AP Timer & Keep-Alive**

The SoftAP runs for **60 seconds** by default. About **30 seconds before** that window expires, the WebUI shows a *"Stay in WebUI?"* prompt — clicking **Stay** extends the window to a **5 minute** rolling timer so you have room to actually use the WebUI. The same prompt re-appears 30 seconds before the 5 minute timer expires; clicking Stay again resets it.

- **Stay** — extends (or re-extends) the window to 5 minutes.
- **Start Scanning Now** — closes the AP immediately and begins wardriving.
- **Ignored / browser closed** — timer runs out, AP closes, scanning starts.

The OLED shows the live countdown (`AP: 192.168.4.1 60s` initially, `m:ss` once extended). Once your home Wi-Fi is configured, the device will connect to it on subsequent boots and the WebUI is reachable on the STA IP shown on the OLED — the AP only comes up if STA fails.

**Location:** `/wardriver.cfg` on the SD card root

### Auto-Start Wardriving After Uploads — How to Disable

> **Important:** When `autoStartAfterUpload=true`, the device disconnects from your home Wi-Fi immediately after uploads finish and goes straight into wardriving. Because it no longer holds the STA connection, the web UI is **not** reachable on your home network after boot.

To disable this setting after it has been enabled, you have two options:

**Option 1 — Connect via the Wardriver AP**

When Piglet is away from the saved home network (or the home network is unavailable), it falls back to its own SoftAP. Connect to it and use the web UI:

1. Power on the device somewhere the home Wi-Fi is not in range (or temporarily forget the home network on the device by clearing `homeSsid` in the config)
2. Connect your phone or laptop to the **Wardriver SSID** (default: `Piglet-WARDRIVE` / `wardrive1234`)
3. Open a browser and go to **`http://192.168.4.1`**
4. In the **Configuration** section, set **Auto-Start Wardriving After Uploads** to **Disabled**
5. Click **Save & Reboot**

**Option 2 — Edit the SD card directly**

1. Remove the SD card from the device
2. Open `wardriver.cfg` in any text editor
3. Change `autoStartAfterUpload=true` to `autoStartAfterUpload=false`
4. Save the file, re-insert the SD card, and reboot

| Adafruit SSD1306 | Adafruit | OLED display driver |
| Adafruit BusIO | Adafruit | Required by SSD1306 |
| ArduinoJson | Benoit Blanchon | v6.x or v7.x |
| NimBLE-Arduino | h2zero | **v2.1.x** — only for BLE builds (`bleEnabled=true` or PigletNode) |

All other headers (`WiFi`, `WebServer`, `WiFiClientSecure`, `HTTPClient`, `SD`, `SPI`, `Wire`, `esp_now.h`, `esp_wifi.h`) are included in the ESP32 Arduino core — no separate install needed.

### Required Libraries — T-Dongle C5 Variant

Install via Arduino Library Manager:

| Library | Author | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Adafruit ST7735 and ST7789 Library | Adafruit | TFT display driver |
| Adafruit GFX Library | Adafruit | Graphics dependency |
| Adafruit BusIO | Adafruit | Required by ST7735 |
| TinyGPSPlus | Mikal Hart | GPS NMEA parsing |
| ArduinoJson | Benoit Blanchon | v6.x or v7.x |
| NimBLE-Arduino | h2zero | v2.x — BLE wardriving (`bleEnabled`) |

All networking, SPI, SD, ESP-Now, and ESP-IDF headers are built into the ESP32 core.

### Flash Steps

1. Select the correct **XIAO ESP32 board** variant (S3, C5, or C6)
2. **CRITICAL:** Enable **PSRAM** (required for TLS/HTTPS uploads)
   - Tools → PSRAM → **OPI PSRAM** (C5/C6) or **QSPI PSRAM** (S3)
3. Use a **large app partition scheme** → **Huge APP (3MB No OTA/1MB SPIFFS)**
4. Upload firmware  
5. Insert **FAT32-formatted SD card**  
6. Add `/wardriver.cfg` to SD card root with your WiGLE API key and WiFi credentials
7. Restart device with RST button or power cycle

### Where to Order

I always order everything from JLCPCB because i get the best deals.  However i do understand that people prefer the all in one project offers of PCBway so i have created this project here:
